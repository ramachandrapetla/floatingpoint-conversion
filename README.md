Application files can be found in the following repository [https://github.com/ramachandrapetla/floatingpoint-conversion]

This application is hosted in Netlify. You can view it here [https://frosty-spence-b0d37e.netlify.app/]

## Getting Started with App

### `npm install`

Installs the dependencies required to run the application.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

=================================================================

### `Project Assignment`

Create an application tool for a user to handle IEEE 754 floating point numbers (Refer to the specification from 1985 and the Project PPT shown in class).

A. The app should convert a decimal (single precision 32bit floating point) number so it can display all of the following:
1. Decimal, 2. Sign Exponent Mantissa display of (binary) bits, 3. Hexadecimal display

B. The app should be a simple calculator that allows it to operate on two input numbers and generate a correct result with the following operators:
1. Addition, 2. Subtraction, 3. Multiplication

C. The app should be able to display the input values and the result in all three display formats listed in A. above.

D. The app should be able to identify the following characteristic of inputs and result as follows:
1. Normalized Floating Point Number
2. Denormalized Floating Point Number
3. Not a number (NaN)
4. Zero

E. The user must be able to submit input values in all of the following formats (when entering two values both use
the same format):
1. Decimal, 2. Binary, 3. Hexadecimal, 4. Sign Exponent Mantissa display of (binary) bits OR Sign Exponent Mantissa
   display of 3 hexadecimal values
